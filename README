ironvas
=======
ironvas is a *highly experimental* integration of Open Vulnerability
Assessment System ([OpenVAS] [1]) into a MAP-Infrastructure. The integration
aims to share security related informations (vulnerabilities
detected by OpenVAS) with other network components in the [TNC architecture] [2]
via IF-MAP.

At the moment only the publish operation for vulnerability information
is supported. Future enhancements are likely to include more functionality.


Requirements
============
* OpenJDK Version 1.6
* OpenVAS-4
* MAP server implementation (e.g. [irond] [3])
* [ifmapj] [3]
* Maven 3

The remaining dependencies should be handled by Maven.


Configuration
=============
You need to import the OpenVAS and MAP server certificates into
`src/main/resources/keystore.jks`.
On a Ubuntu installation of OpenVAS you can find the OpenVAS certificate in
`/var/lib/openvas/CA/servercert.pem`.

The remaining configuration parameters can be done through the
`src/main/resources/configuration.properties` file in the ironvas package.
In general you have to specify:

* the OpenVAS server IP address,
* the OpenVAS OMP port,
* the OpenVAS OMP credentials,
* the MAPS URL and credentials.

Have a look at `src/main/resources/configuration.properties.example`.


Building
========
Before you can build ironvas you need to install ifmapj in your local Maven
repository. To do so download ifmapj from the [Trust@FHH website] [3], unzip it
and execute

	$ mvn install

to have it avaiable.

Now you can build ironvas, simply execute:

	$ mvn package

in the root directory of the ironvas project.
Maven should download all further needed dependencies for you. After a successful
build you should find the `ironvas-x.x.x.jar` in the `target` subdirectory.


Running
=======
To run ironvas simply execute:

	$ java -jar ironvas-x.x.x.jar

The amount of logging output can be configured in `logging.properties`.
