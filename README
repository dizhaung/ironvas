ironvas
=======
This package contains a *highly experimental* integration of Open Vulnerability
Assessment System ([OpenVAS][1]) into a MAP-Infrastructure. The integration
aims to share security related informations (vulnerabilities
detected by OpenVAS) with other network components in the [TNC architecture][2]
via IF-MAP.

At the moment only the publish operation for vulnerability information
is supported. Future enhancements are likely to include more functionality.


Requirements
============
* Java Runtime Environment 1.6

* OpenVAS-4
* MAP server implementation (e.g. [irond][3])
* Maven 3 (only for building from source)

The remaining dependencies should be handled by Maven.


Configuration
=============
You need to import the OpenVAS and MAP server certificates into `keystore.jks`.
The remaining configuration parameters can be done through the
`configuration.properties` file. In general you have to specify:

* the OpenVAS server IP address,
* the OpenVAS OMP port,
* the OpenVAS OMP credentials,
* the MAPS URL and credentials.


Building
========
To build ironvas from source you can use Maven, simply execute:

	$ mvn package

in the root directory of the project.
Maven should download all further needed dependencies for you. After a successful
build you should find the `ironvas-x.x.x.jar` in the `target` subdirectory.


Running
=======
To run ironvas simply execute:

	$ java -jar ironvas-x.x.x.jar

The amount of logging output can be configured in `logging.properties`.
