ironvas
=======
ironvas is a *highly experimental* integration of Open Vulnerability
Assessment System ([OpenVAS] [1]) into a MAP-Infrastructure. The integration
aims to share security related informations (vulnerabilities
detected by OpenVAS) with other network components in the [TNC architecture] [2]
via IF-MAP.

At the moment only the publish operation for vulnerability information
is supported. Future enhancements are likely to include more functionality.


Requirements
============
To use the binary package of ironvas you need the following components:

* OpenJDK Version 1.6
* OpenVAS-4
* MAP server implementation (e.g. [irond] [3])
* [ifmapj] [3]

If you have downloaded the source package and want to build ironvas by
yourself Maven 3 is also needed.


Configuration
=============
To setup the binary package you need to import the OpenVAS and MAP server
certificates into `keystore.jks`.
On a Ubuntu installation of OpenVAS you can find the OpenVAS certificate in
`/var/lib/openvas/CA/servercert.pem`.

The remaining configuration parameters can be done through the
`configuration.properties` file in the ironvas package.
In general you have to specify:

* the OpenVAS server IP address,
* the OpenVAS OMP port,
* the OpenVAS OMP credentials,
* the MAPS URL and credentials.

Have a look at the comments in `configuration.properties` for more details.


Building
========
Before you can build ironvas (if you have downloaded the source package)
you need to install ifmapj in your local Maven
repository. To do so download ifmapj from the [Trust@FHH website] [3], unzip it
and execute

	$ mvn install

to have it avaiable.

Now you can build ironvas, simply execute:

	$ mvn package

in the root directory of the ironvas project.
Maven should download all further needed dependencies for you. After a successful
build you should find the `ironvas-x.x.x.jar` in the `target` subdirectory.

**Note** that the `package` phase creates a single executable JAR of ironvas. To
include a `keystore.jks` and a `configuration.properties` in this JAR file place
both files in `src/main/resources` before executing the `package` phase.

If you want to build a binary package (not a single big JAR) you can do so by
running the `assembly:assembly` goal instead.


Running
=======
To run the binary package of ironvas simply execute:

	$ ./start.sh

The resulting JAR of the `package` phase can be started with:

	$ java -jar ironvas-x.x.x.jar
